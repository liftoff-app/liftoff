### End User Code of Conduct

We want Liftoff! to be a great way of interacting with the Lemmy network in a safe manner. The Lemmy admins and the Lemmy moderators will have no tolerance for objectionable content or abusive users.

Users of this app must read and follow the Lemmy Code of Conduct. https://join-lemmy.org/docs/code_of_conduct.html

In particular you should understand that:

- Your site admins and community moderators have put in place mechanisms for filtering objectionable material from being posted to their sites. This includes blocking of content using banned terms among other tools.
- Users are required to mark content as NSFW as appropriate. Such content will be automatically filtered out for your account unless you choose to allow it. Additionally the app will also, by default, obscure all content identified as NSFW and require you to click through to view it.
- If users have concerns about individual posts or comments, they can report such offensive content to the moderators by using the “…” menu and selecting “Report Post” or “Report Comment”. These reports will result in timely responses or actions, which may include the blocking of users, communities or instances.
- Additionally you can use the “…” menu to immediately block individual users and communities from your own timeline.
- The administrators of each instance can be contacted via the home page of that instance. The moderators of each community are listed in the community’s about box and may be contacted directly.

You can always post to our support community at https://lemmy.world/c/liftoff, or by email at liftoffapp@protonmail.com if your concerns are not being addressed by these channels.
